// Create an OOP "carpark" system
// at its most basic, the static CarPark class will have a private hashset of vehicles
// and a method: public static void Park (Vehicle vehicle)
// Vehicles have a string License number, and a string ParkingSpot
// Both should be private and validated with public properties 

// when the Park method is invoked, it adds the vehicle to the CarPark hashset, counts
// the vehicles in the HashSet, and uses that number to assign a spot.
// If 20 vehicles are parked, then the 21st vehicle parked is given spot 21.

// It should prevent a vehicle from parking in more than one spot (if it already has a spot)
// or if the spots are over capacity
